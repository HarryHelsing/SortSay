In this project so far I have learned this
- How to use a vector
- How to map onto a vector and map a vector onto a string
- I used my first tuple
- Learning about closures | like this | and how they can act as an anonymous function
- Learning different sorting algorithms such as: bubble sort, gnome sort(stupid sort), radix sort, merge sort
- (Note: using a lot of resources to make these algorithms, not yet confident in writing them myself.)
- Learning how to better read and understand code
- Bubble sort: compares two elements then swaps if needed as it moves up the list
- Radix sort: counts the digits 0-9, 00-90, 000-900, and sorts into buckets
